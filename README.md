## usage

### Search by Character

The first of three search bars is the "Search By Character" approach. Using this, a user 
can type in any name of an existing character form the show and click "Search Characters". 
if the character exists, a character card will appear below the search bars at the bototm 
of the page. This character card will contain a handful of information about the individual 
including status (alive, dead, unknown), species, and information about their origin and last 
known locations. At the bottom of each card, the user can click opn the "See Episodes" button 
to reveal a list of all episodes this specific character appeared in throughout the show.

Assuming the user doesnt know the full name of the character, but knows some portion of the 
name, such as knowing the desired character is a version of Rick but is unsure which one, 
the user may simply type in "rick" to reveal a list of character cards with the keyword 
existing in thier name.
